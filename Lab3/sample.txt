Class String, class StringBuffer and class Character 
from the java.lang package and class StringTokenizer 
from the java.util package provide the foundation for 
string and character processing in Java.

Class String provides many capabilities for processing 
strings, including creating strings, comparing strings, 
locating and extracting substrings, and concatenating 
strings.

However, once a String object is created, its contents 
can not change. Class StringBuffer therefore provides 
capabilities for creating and manipulating dynamic 
strings, that is, strings that can change.

Class Character is the type-wrapper class for the built-in 
data type char, and provides many capabilities for processing 
characters, including testing and converting characters.

Class StringTokenizer, finally, provides capabilities 
for breaking a string into tokens, that is, individual 
substrings, each of which conveys meaning to you.
